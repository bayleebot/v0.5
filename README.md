  ## About v0.5

  Baylee is based on a bot I originally created for my Minecraft server, [The Outpost](https://playoutpost.com). This version of Baylee is a forked slightly dumbed down version of the original bot. v0.5 is poorly documented and hasn't been updated in a couple of years. Good luck getting her to run :)
